## Key Components
### _Client_
- MultiStepForm (PersonalInfo + ProfessionalDetails)
- ApplicationList (Table view with filters)
- ApplicationModal (Detail view + PDF export)
- FormPersistenceManager (localStorage handling)
- ValidationResolver (Zod + custom business rules)

### _Server_

- ApplicationsEndpoint (GET /api/applications)
- PDFExportService (POST /api/export-pdf)
- FileUploadMiddleware (multer configuration)
- SecurityMiddleware (CORS + rate limiting)

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: React + TypeScript, react-hook-form, Zod, react-datepicker
- Backend: Express.js, multer, pdfkit
- Build: Vite
- Styling: CSS Modules

## Challenges
1. Complex Form Management
- Coordinating multi-step navigation with validation
- Handling file uploads in React Hook Form
- Persisting form state across page reloads
- Implementing cross-field validation rules

2. Data Handling
- Secure file uploads and storage
- PDF generation with dynamic content
- Pagination with sorting/filtering
- Data masking for privacy protection

3. State Management
- Synchronizing form state with UI state
- Managing application list filters/pagination
- Handling async operations with loading/error states

4. Validation Complexity
- Combining Zod schema validation with custom business rules
- Conditional validation based on user selections
- File type/size validation on client and server

5. UI/UX Considerations
- Accessible form controls and error messages
- Responsive table layout for application list
- Consistent styling across components
- Performance optimization for large datasets

1. Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+ (v20)
- npm v9+

2. Server Setup
```
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Configure environment variables in .env
npm run dev
```

3. Client Setup
